    contains granular detail and depth on the source of funds. Please provide details
    of the source of funds to be introduced into the account(s), to include how the
    remitter has been able to generate the initial deposit, e.g. through employment,
    inheritance, investor funding or similar. If applicable, please provide detail
    of the remitter’s background and business activities. Please include as much detail
    as possible as this will help to speed up the account opening process. Example
    - The funds were generated from the investment activity that is confirmed within
    the source of wealth information. Continuing activity will generate funds from
    the sale of stocks and the payment of dividends.
