# Session Summary

Goal: Run full analysis on the KYCP prototype following the Complete Workflow Guide and establish analysis documentation area.

## Context

Continued from Session 011 where we:
- Completed KYCP component visual parity
- Processed 20250911_master_non-lux.xlsx spreadsheet
- Created tone analysis tool
- Documented complete workflow

## Today's Accomplishments

### 1. Full Analysis Execution
- Followed Complete Workflow Guide step-by-step
- Verified KYCP journey data and schema (788 fields, 311 internal)
- Ran tone of voice analysis on schema
- Generated CSV report with 438 issues identified
- Created comprehensive analysis report

### 2. Analysis Results Summary
**Tone Issues Found**: 438 total
- High severity: 51 (11.6%)
- Medium severity: 343 (78.3%)
- Low severity: 44 (10.0%)

**Issue Types**:
- Jargon: 127 (29.0%)
- Too Long: 110 (25.1%)
- Complex Sentence: 90 (20.5%)
- Pronoun Usage: 67 (15.3%)
- Passive Voice: 44 (10.0%)

### 3. Documentation Area Created
Established new analysis area at `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/` with:
- README.md - Overview and navigation
- PRD-tone-analysis-system.md - Product requirements
- ADR-001-csv-output.md - Architecture decision record
- ADR-002-human-in-loop.md - Human review process decision
- implementation-plan.md - Phased rollout strategy

### 4. Key Insights
- Many questions exceed 20-word guideline (up to 72 words)
- Banking jargon prevalent ("entity", "jurisdiction", "domiciled")
- Third-person references need conversion to second-person
- Complex multi-part questions should be split

## Technical Validation

### Workflow Guide Validation
Successfully completed all phases:
- ✅ Phase 1: Data preparation
- ✅ Phase 2: Import and generation  
- ✅ Phase 3: Tone analysis
- ✅ Phase 4: Prototype configuration
- ✅ Phase 5: Quality assurance
- ✅ Phase 6: Documentation
- ⏸️ Phase 7: Deployment (optional)

### System Components Working
- KYCP journey accessible at `/preview-kycp/non-lux-lp-demo-kycp`
- All KYCP components rendering correctly
- Visibility conditions functional
- CSV report generated for stakeholder review

## Files Created/Modified

### Analysis outputs
- `apps/prototype/data/generated/analysis/non-lux-lp-demo-kycp-tone-analysis.csv`
- `apps/prototype/data/generated/analysis/ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`

### Documentation structure
- `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/README.md`
- `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/PRD-tone-analysis-system.md`
- `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/ADR-001-csv-output.md`
- `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/ADR-002-human-in-loop.md`
- `Documents/01 Areas/analysis/implementation-plan.md`

## Next Session Tasks

### Immediate
1. Share CSV with stakeholders for review
2. Process stakeholder decisions on tone changes
3. Update source spreadsheet with accepted improvements
4. Re-run import with improved content

### Short-term
1. Implement Phase 1 of implementation plan
2. Create automated pre-import validation
3. Build tone improvement tracking dashboard
4. Test with additional journey spreadsheets

### Long-term
1. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
2. Create self-service portal for content teams
3. Develop ML-based improvement suggestions
4. Build comprehensive metrics dashboard

## Metrics & Success Indicators

- **Analysis Coverage**: 100% of fields analyzed
- **Issue Detection Rate**: 438/788 fields (55.6%) have tone issues
- **High Priority Issues**: 51 fields need immediate attention
- **Process Time**: < 1 minute for full analysis
- **Human Review Ready**: CSV format familiar to stakeholders

## Decision Log

1. **CSV Format**: Chosen for stakeholder familiarity over JSON/web interface
2. **Human-in-Loop**: Maintains editorial control while leveraging automation
3. **Severity Levels**: Three-tier system (High/Medium/Low) for prioritization
4. **Source Tracking**: ROW:XXX references maintain full traceability
5. **Analysis Area**: Separate documentation area for analysis system specs

## Handover Notes

The tone analysis system is now fully operational and documented. The next session should focus on:

1. Processing stakeholder feedback from CSV review
2. Implementing accepted changes
3. Beginning Phase 1 of implementation plan
4. Setting up automated validation checks

All necessary documentation is in place for independent operation of the analysis workflow.
