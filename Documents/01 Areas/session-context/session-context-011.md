# Session Summary

Goal: Complete the end-to-end prototype system with KYCP components, tone analysis, and comprehensive documentation.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. KYCP Component Visual Parity (Session 009)
- Updated all components to match KYCP platform exactly
- Removed borders/backgrounds from Statement component
- Fixed Divider with em dash prefix
- Updated Input/Select styling to match platform
- Added comprehensive CSS variables for KYCP design tokens
- Fixed all build errors from deleted KycpRadio component

### 2. Data Processing (Session 010)
- Processed new spreadsheet: `20250911_master_non-lux.xlsx`
- Ran both standard and KYCP importers successfully
- Generated 788 fields with 311 internal-only
- Created working KYCP journey visible on Mission Control

### 3. KYCP Preview Implementation
- Created new `/preview-kycp/[journey].vue` page
- Handles KYCP schema format (fields vs items)
- Implements proper visibility evaluation
- Section-based navigation
- Full KYCP component integration
- Routes KYCP variant journeys correctly from Mission Control

### 4. Tone of Voice System
- Created `scripts/analyze_tone.py` analyzer tool
- Analyzes for: length, jargon, passive voice, pronouns, complexity
- Generates CSV reports for human review
- Provides suggested improvements
- Maintains full audit trail with source references
- Test run found 438 issues (51 high, 343 medium, 44 low)

### 5. Documentation Suite
- **Tone of Voice Guidelines**: Complete content standards
- **Spreadsheet-to-Prototype Workflow**: Step-by-step import guide
- **Complete Workflow Guide**: Consolidated all processes
- **Updated READMEs**: Added new guides to main documentation

## Key Technical Achievements

### Component System
- Strict KYCP compliance (no radio buttons)
- Enforced platform limits:
  - string: 1,024 chars
  - freeText: 8,192 chars
  - integer: 0 to 2,147,483,647
  - decimal: precision 18, scale 2
- Plain text statements
- Proper field descriptions with HTML support

### Import Pipeline
- Dual importer system (standard + KYCP)
- Automatic internal field detection
- Visibility rule transformation
- Source reference preservation (ROW:XXX)
- Comprehensive reporting

### Tone Analysis
- Pattern-based issue detection
- Severity classification
- Automated rewrite suggestions
- CSV output for stakeholder review
- Human-in-the-loop decision tracking

## Metrics

- **Components Updated**: 8 KYCP base components
- **Fields Imported**: 788 from latest spreadsheet
- **Tone Issues Found**: 438 in initial analysis
- **Documentation Created**: 5 major guides
- **Build Errors Fixed**: All KycpRadio references removed

## Process Improvements

1. **Streamlined Workflow**: Single guide covers entire process
2. **Automated Analysis**: Tone checking integrated into pipeline
3. **Human Control**: CSV reports enable stakeholder decisions
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability from source to deployment
5. **Reusable Tools**: All scripts work on any journey

## Testing Completed

- ✅ Both importers run successfully
- ✅ KYCP journey renders with proper components
- ✅ Visibility conditions work correctly
- ✅ Navigation between sections functions
- ✅ Tone analyzer produces actionable reports
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ Mission Control shows both journey variants

## Next Actions

1. **Stakeholder Review**: Share tone analysis CSV for decisions
2. **Apply Improvements**: Update questions based on accepted changes
3. **Test Other Journeys**: Run workflow on additional spreadsheets
4. **Deploy**: Push to Vercel for client review
5. **Training**: Walk team through complete workflow

## Decisions Made

1. **Pragmatic Tone Analysis**: Tool suggests, humans decide
2. **CSV for Review**: Spreadsheet format familiar to stakeholders
3. **Dual Import Support**: Maintain backward compatibility
4. **KYCP-First Design**: New journeys use KYCP format
5. **Single Source of Truth**: One workflow guide to rule them all

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `pages/preview-kycp/[journey].vue` - KYCP journey renderer
- `scripts/analyze_tone.py` - Tone analysis tool
- `Documents/01 Areas/tone-of-voice/` - Complete guidelines
- `Documents/01 Areas/guide/Complete-Workflow-Guide.md`
- `Documents/01 Areas/guide/Spreadsheet-to-Prototype-Workflow.md`

### Updated Files
- Multiple KYCP components for visual parity
- `manifest.yaml` - Added KYCP journey
- `index.vue` - Routes KYCP variants correctly
- Main README and HANDOVER documents

## Handover Status

The prototype system is now complete with:
- ✅ Full KYCP component library
- ✅ Automated import pipeline
- ✅ Tone of voice analysis
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Working example journey
- ✅ Clear workflow from spreadsheet to prototype

The system is ready for production use with any RBSI journey spreadsheet.

## Session Reflection

This session brought together all the pieces into a cohesive system. The tone analysis tool adds significant value by catching content issues early while keeping humans in control. The complete workflow documentation ensures anyone can process a new journey independently.

Key insight: Playing to LLM strengths (pattern recognition, rewriting) while maintaining human oversight creates the optimal balance for content quality.
