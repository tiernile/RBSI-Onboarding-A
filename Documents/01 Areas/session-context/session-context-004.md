# Session Summary

Goal: Harden the prototype pipeline, make imports robust, and ensure deploys (Vercel) reliably read data and expose admin controls. Outcome: Importer and visibility engine upgraded; data directory relocated into the app; deploy health checks added; journeys render correctly with lookup options.

## Changes Made

- Importer CLI: header autodetect, mandatory normalization, robust lookup loader (LOOKUP TYPE/LOOKUP VALUE), case‑safe visibility normalization, ordering options; emits summary/decisions reports.
- Mapping Wizard: interactive creator for mappings with fuzzy header suggestions and optional filters.
- Visibility Engine: parser supports parentheses, &&/||, includes, numeric compares; string equality is case‑insensitive.
- Zod Validator: error handling compatible with Zod v4 (issues/errors) and clearer failures.
- Zelda journey: created mapping + schema (as‑is labels), manifest entry added (visible); fallback labels set when live copy empty.
- Non‑Lux LP demo: re‑imported with correct lookup options (e.g., Investment Sub‑sector → 12 options; select not radio).
- Deployment: moved data → `apps/prototype/data/`; Nuxt config auto‑detects data dir and bundles server assets for Vercel; added `/api/health`.
- Docs: added/updated System Overview, Area Workflow, Visibility Rules, Operations (importer + wizard), root README, AGENTS.

## Decisions

- Use Python for importer; keep deterministic, auditable pipeline.
- Lookup = dropdown (select), including Yes/No when provided via lookup.
- Only latest journey visible by default in manifest; can override with `MC_VISIBLE`.
- Bundle data with the app for Vercel; avoid runtime absolute paths.

## Findings

- As‑is HTML ↔ spreadsheet: 158/158 mapped, 0 mandatory mismatches after normalization; 1 minor label diff.
- Initial lookups loader missed "LOOKUP TYPE" header; fixed; options now resolved (e.g., Investment Sub‑sector).
- Vercel read‑only FS: Diff/Export return content but on‑disk writes may not persist.

## Next Actions

- Add a “serverless mode” to skip writing Diff/Export files and only stream responses.
- Optional: pnpm scripts for importer/wizard commands; minimal tests for visibility parser and importer normalization.
- Confirm admin login on deploy with `NUXT_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` (bcrypt) and validate `/api/health`.

## Risks / Mitigations

- Varying sheet formats → wizard + tolerant header matching; clear reports for gaps.
- Serverless constraints → stream artifacts; avoid write failures.
- Visibility complexity → bounded grammar; fail‑safe (non‑visible) on invalid expressions.

## Artifacts

- Schemas: `apps/prototype/data/schemas/{non-lux-lp-demo, zelda}/schema.yaml`
- Reports: `apps/prototype/data/generated/importer-cli/<journey>/{summary.json, decisions.json}`
- Health: `/api/health` (dataDir, manifestExists, journeyCount)
- Journeys visible on Mission Control (latest by default).
