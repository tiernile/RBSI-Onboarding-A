# Session Summary

Goal: Close the loop on conditionality correctness (AS‑IS fidelity), wire complex groups as first‑class, add explainability and admin reports, and stand up a simple, LLM‑assisted language review that runs from this environment.

## Delivered

1) Conditionality hardening
- Importer parser now supports AND/OR (quote‑aware), avoids rewriting operators inside values.
- Canonicalization aligns condition values to controller options via `value_aliases` (e.g., USA → United States).
- Conditions Report expanded: alias coverage (UK/USA), parse_error lint when operator tokens leak into values.
- Fixed real case: Investment Adviser USA fork now shows correctly (USA → United States).

2) Complex groups as first‑class
- Parent rows with `DATA TYPE = Complex` emit `type: complex` with `children` and optional `titleField`.
- Preview prefers complex parents, hides them from flat lists, and respects container visibility.

3) UX improvements
- Explain visibility toggle floats bottom‑right; also available via `?explain=1`.
- Divider title larger and KYCP blue.
- Admin: Conditions Report link added on each Mission Control card.

4) Docs
- Updated guides (Spreadsheet Workflow, Complete Workflow, Visibility Rules, QuickStart, Deployments) to match current importer, explain visibility, Conditions Report, complex groups, and scenarios.
- New doc: `LLM-Analysis.md` — simple, locked‑prompt, human‑in‑the‑loop language review.

5) Analysis tooling
- Field inventory CLI: writes `fields.csv` and `summary.json` (counts by type/section, controllers, unresolved).
- LLM batch prep: generates JSONL prompts per field with a strict system prompt and expected JSON schema.
- Merge utility: ingests JSONL responses and writes `language-llm.csv` for bulk review.
- Demonstrated sample run on 7 fields, merged to CSV.

## Verification
- Scenarios: 3 passing (`pnpm scenarios`) including UK path (with Pre‑App), non‑UK path, Adviser USA fork.
- Conditions Report: `/api/conditions-report/non-lux-1-1?format=html` renders; no parse_error for the fixed cases.
- Field inventory: `pnpm fields` → totals: fields=357; withVisibility=226; required=282; complexParents=14; complexChildren=67.
- LLM batch: `pnpm analyze:prepare` wrote 305 items; `pnpm analyze:merge` merged sample to CSV.

## Open Items / Next Steps
- Linter: read value_aliases from mapping.json in the API to avoid drift; extend aliases beyond UK/USA.
- Admin UX: add "Download LLM Batch" + optional "Upload LLM Responses" buttons per journey.
- Complex groups: infer friendlier parent labels when synthesized; optional parent‑required (≥1 row) validation.
- Broaden scenarios to cover additional OR cases and complex groups.
- Remaining unresolved lookups (if any) to be resolved in Lookup Values or mapping fallbacks.

## Commands (quick)
```bash
cd apps/prototype

# Import / regenerate schema
python3 scripts/import_non_lux_1_1.py

# Run scenarios
pnpm scenarios

# Conditions Report (admin link also on card)
# http://localhost:3000/api/conditions-report/non-lux-1-1?format=html

# Field inventory
pnpm fields

# LLM batch (prepare → run externally → merge)
pnpm analyze:prepare
# place responses at data/generated/analysis/non-lux-1-1/llm_responses.jsonl
pnpm analyze:merge
```

## Notes
- Parentheses in visibility are not supported; rules flatten to AND/OR and are preserved accordingly.
- We never add “demo” options to missing lookups; unresolved lookups remain flagged until provided.
