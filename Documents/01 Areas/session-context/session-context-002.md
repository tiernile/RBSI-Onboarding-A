# Session Summary

- Goal: Analyze the as-is KYCP form implementation and create an auditable process to recreate the current journey with KYCP-faithful components
- Outcome: Complete extraction, mapping, and schema generation for 158 form fields with full audit trail and component specifications

## Changes Made

### New Files Created

**Analysis Documentation**
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/README.md – Overview of as-is analysis process
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/field-inventory.md – Complete list of 158 extracted HTML fields
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/field-mapping.md – Bidirectional mapping between HTML and spreadsheet
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/component-analysis.md – KYCP component specifications for faithful recreation
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/schema-generation-report.md – Summary of generated schema
- File: Documents/01 Areas/as-is-analysis/audit-trail.md – Complete transformation documentation with traceability

**Data Files**
- File: data/schemas/as-is-journey/schema.yaml – Complete schema with 158 field definitions
- File: data/generated/as-is-audit/extracted-fields.json – Raw HTML field extraction data
- File: data/generated/as-is-audit/field-mappings.json – Field mapping with confidence scores

**Scripts**
- File: scripts/extract-html-fields.py – HTML parsing and field extraction
- File: scripts/map-spreadsheet-to-html.py – Fuzzy matching between HTML and spreadsheet
- File: scripts/generate-as-is-schema.py – Schema generation with full metadata

## Key Findings

- **Coverage**: Current HTML form implements 158 of 697 spreadsheet questions (23% coverage)
- **Components**: 5 KYCP component types identified: dropdown (67), text_input (45), textarea (28), complex_field (12), radio (6)
- **Mapping Quality**: 100% of HTML fields successfully mapped; 90% with high confidence (>90% match score)
- **Mandatory Fields**: 87 of 158 fields marked as mandatory in HTML

## Decisions

- Use fuzzy string matching with 70% threshold for field mapping – provides good balance of accuracy and coverage
- Preserve HTML question text as primary label (user-facing) with spreadsheet KEYNAME as ID
- Default to "Yes/No" options for boolean questions when lookup values unavailable
- Include full metadata in schema for complete audit trail
- Create Python scripts for repeatability and future updates

## Technical Specifications

### KYCP Components Identified
1. **v-select dropdown** – Searchable dropdown with typeahead, "None Selected" default
2. **Text input** – Standard and decimal variants with validation
3. **Textarea** – 6 rows default, max length validation
4. **Complex field** – Container for grouped/repeatable field sets
5. **Toggle switch** – Checkbox rendered as switch for hide/show functionality

### Component Patterns
- Bootstrap CSS classes (form-control, col-12, mb-2)
- Custom classes (dropdownSelect, fieldContainer, effisComplex)
- Visibility conditions via style="display: none"
- Mandatory indicator via asterisk in label
- Warning icon capability for validation errors

## Open Questions

- Lookup values structure – Spreadsheet "Lookup Values" sheet appears empty or different format – owner: Tiernan
- Section mapping – HTML doesn't clearly indicate section boundaries – owner: Assistant
- Visibility conditions – Complex JavaScript logic needs extraction and parsing – owner: Assistant
- Validation rules – Regex patterns and business rules need documentation – owner: Tiernan
- Component behaviors – Exact KYCP component props and events need confirmation – owner: FinOpz

## Plan and Status

- [x] Create as-is analysis directory structure
- [x] Extract and document all HTML form fields
- [x] Analyze spreadsheet and create field mapping
- [x] Build KYCP component specifications
- [x] Generate as-is schema with full metadata
- [x] Create audit and comparison reports
- [ ] Build KYCP-faithful Vue components
- [ ] Create as-is journey page using components
- [ ] Validate recreation against original HTML
- [ ] Client review and sign-off

## Next Actions

- Build KYCP-faithful Vue components based on specifications – owner: Assistant – due: Week 2
- Create as-is journey page using new components and schema – owner: Assistant – due: Week 2
- Extract and parse JavaScript visibility conditions – owner: Assistant – due: Week 2
- Obtain lookup values mapping from client – owner: Tiernan – due: When available
- Review mapping results with client team – owner: Tiernan – due: Next client meeting

## Risks / Mitigations

- Component behavior mismatch – mitigation: Document all assumptions, create component showcase for validation
- Missing lookup values – mitigation: Use sensible defaults, flag for client review
- Complex visibility logic – mitigation: Start with simple conditions, enhance iteratively
- Schema completeness – mitigation: Include source references for every field, maintain audit trail
