# Session Summary

- Goal: Improve Mission Control design, create KYCP-faithful component library, and integrate components into preview pages.
- Outcome: Mission Control redesigned with flat, professional aesthetic; complete KYCP component library built; component showcase created; ready to integrate into preview pages.

## Changes Made

### Mission Control Improvements
- File: apps/prototype/app.vue – Fixed CSS variable scoping issue by moving variables to global scope
- File: apps/prototype/pages/index.vue – Redesigned with flat, clean aesthetic:
  - Light gray background (#FAFBFC) with white cards
  - Bold status pills (alpha=red, beta=amber, live=green)
  - Black filled primary buttons
  - Professional typography and spacing
  - Added "Components" link to header
- File: Documents/01 Areas/mission-control-design.md – Created design guide documenting the flat, journey-agnostic design

### KYCP Component System
- Created design-system documentation area with PRD, ADR, and README
- Built custom Vue 3 components matching KYCP style:
  - KycpInput – Text input with all states
  - KycpSelect – Dropdown with custom arrow
  - KycpRadio – Radio button groups
  - KycpFieldWrapper – Label, help, and error container
  - KycpFieldGroup – Gray header container (matches reference image)
  - KycpTag – Removable chip/pill components
- File: apps/prototype/assets/kycp-design.css – Design system tokens and variables
- File: apps/prototype/pages/showcase.vue – Interactive component showcase with code examples

### Key Design Decisions
- **Custom components over libraries** – Built from scratch for exact KYCP match
- **Flat design philosophy** – No shadows or gradients, clean borders
- **Separation of concerns** – Mission Control design != Form UI design
- **TypeScript support** – All components have typed props
- **Accessibility first** – ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation

## Decisions

- Build custom components rather than use PrimeVue/Vuetify/etc for exact KYCP match
- Keep Mission Control design journey-agnostic and unbranded
- Use CSS custom properties for theming consistency
- Create storybook-style showcase for component documentation
- Components use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript

## CSS Scoping Issue Resolved

**Problem**: CSS variables defined in `<style scoped>` don't work globally in Vue
**Solution**: Moved all CSS variables to app.vue in non-scoped style block
**Learning**: Document this in CLAUDE.md to prevent future issues

## Open Questions

- Component animations and transitions – how much is needed?
- Date picker component – build custom or use headless library?
- Multi-select with tags – complexity vs timeline
- Form progress indicator design
- Accessibility testing tools beyond axe

## Plan and Status

### Completed Today
- [x] Mission Control redesign with flat aesthetic
- [x] Fix CSS variable scoping issues
- [x] Create design-system documentation (PRD, ADR)
- [x] Build KYCP base components (Input, Select, Radio, FieldGroup, Tag)
- [x] Create component showcase page
- [x] Link showcase from Mission Control
- [x] Document design decisions

### Next Actions
- [ ] Integrate KYCP components into preview/[journey].vue
- [ ] Update ErrorSummary component with KYCP styling
- [ ] Create KycpTextarea component
- [ ] Test components with non-lux-lp-demo journey
- [ ] Accessibility review of all components
- [ ] Create KycpCheckbox component
- [ ] Update POC workflow status

## Component Specifications

### Colors
- Primary: #0066CC
- Gray header: #808080
- Border: #D0D0D0
- Error: #D32F2F

### Spacing
- Base grid: 8px
- Input padding: 8px 12px
- Field margin: 16px

### Typography
- Base: 14px
- Small: 13px
- Labels: 13px, font-weight 500

## Risks / Mitigations

- Component complexity growing – keep focused on MVP needs
- Accessibility compliance – test early and often
- Browser compatibility – test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Performance with many fields – consider virtualization if needed

## Artifacts and Links

### New Files Created
- Documents/01 Areas/mission-control-design.md
- Documents/01 Areas/design-system/PRD.md
- Documents/01 Areas/design-system/ADR-0001-component-architecture.md
- Documents/01 Areas/design-system/README.md

- apps/prototype/CLAUDE.md

### Modified Files
- apps/prototype/app.vue
- apps/prototype/pages/index.vue

## Final Session Status

### Issues Resolved
- **CSS Variable Scoping**: Fixed by moving variables to app.vue global scope
- **Dynamic Components**: Replaced with v-if/v-else-if for reliability
- **Select Rendering**: Now working with explicit component references
- **Route Confusion**: Mission Control properly on homepage

### Working Features
- Mission Control at localhost:3000/
- Component showcase at /showcase
- Preview pages with KYCP styling at /preview/non-lux-lp-demo
- All KYCP components rendering correctly
- Admin authentication with bcrypt
- Diff and export functionality

### Known Issues for Next Session
- Component hot reload sometimes requires manual refresh
- Error summary needs better anchoring
- Mobile responsiveness needs testing
- Some accessibility improvements pending

## Handover Notes

### Critical Files
- **HANDOVER.md** - Comprehensive project state and instructions
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI assistant specific gotchas
- **kycp-design.css** - Design system tokens
- **preview/[journey].vue** - Lines 45-81 have v-if component logic

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd apps/prototype
pnpm install
pnpm dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Key Learning
- Vue 3 dynamic components work differently than Vue 2
- CSS variables in scoped styles don't work globally
- Nuxt uses .env not .env.local
- Always use v-if for component switching in this project

## Notes

- Component showcase accessible at /showcase
- All components support v-model for two-way binding
- Design system uses CSS custom properties for easy theming
- No external UI library dependencies
- Preview pages fully integrated with KYCP components
- Comprehensive handover document created at Documents/01 Areas/HANDOVER.md
