# Session Summary

Goal: Close the loop on conditionality QA by wiring an at-a-glance Conditions Report into Mission Control and adding a minimal CLI scenario runner to guard key flows.

## Changes

- Mission Control (admin): added "Conditions Report" link on each journey card → `/api/conditions-report/:journey?format=html`.
- New CLI script: `apps/prototype/scripts/scenarios.mjs` with two starter scenarios (UK path; Non-UK + Pre-App Yes).
- NPM script: `pnpm scenarios` runs the checks for `non-lux-1-1`.
- Docs: Added `Documents/01 Areas/refining-workflow/Conditions-Report-and-Scenarios.md` describing endpoints, usage, and acceptance.

## Verification

- Link appears for admin users; opens HTML table with lints and counts.
- `pnpm scenarios` prints `[scenarios] non-lux-1-1 → 2 passed` and exits 0.

## Next Steps

- Expand value alias map in linter (countries, Yes/No synonyms, common abbreviations).
- Add third scenario (Non-UK + Pre-App No) and broaden assertions to option presence for critical lookups.
- Consider extracting linter logic to a shared util so the CLI can reuse it (and CI can run without a dev server).
- Resolve remaining unresolved lookup(s) in `non-lux-1-1` (e.g., `GENStatutoryProvision`) via Lookup Values or mapping fallbacks.
