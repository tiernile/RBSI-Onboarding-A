# Session Summary

Goal: Initiate KYCP component fidelity phase with a dedicated docs area, a developer-ready spec, and a concrete implementation plan; seed the codebase with typed interfaces and helpers aligned to KYCP.

## Changes Made

- New area `Documents/01 Areas/kycp-components/` with:
  - `README.md` – scope and links
  - `Spec.md` – canonical interfaces (FieldStyle, DataType, rights, visibility, validation), limits, behaviours
  - `Implementation-Plan.md` – phased plan for types, adapters, components, showcase, and integration
- Code seed: `apps/prototype/types/kycp.ts` containing types and helper functions `resolveRight` and `isVisible`

## Decisions

- Maintain current YAML schema as the data source; add an adapter to transform into KYCP-aligned `ComponentNode[]` at runtime
- Keep components visible in `/showcase` with realistic examples and edge states
- Track gaps and platform deviations via ADRs as they emerge

## Next Actions

- Build the YAML→ComponentNode adapter (map controls/types, internal flags, visibility)
- Implement leaf components (String, FreeText, Integer, Decimal, Date, Lookup) with validators and rights
- Add Statement/Divider/Button and ComplexGroup repeater
- Expand `/showcase` with KYCP-aligned demos and status/visibility scenarios

## Inputs Needed

- KYCP component docs: prop names, value shapes, validation edge cases
- Status flows and any special cases (read-only after specific transitions, etc.)

## Risks / Mitigations

- Ambiguity in KYCP behaviours → confirm with provided docs; prototype quickly; document ADRs
- Adapter complexity → iterate with the core journeys first; add mappings incrementally
