# FAQ (Plain English)

Q: Is this the final system?
- No. It’s a high‑fidelity prototype that helps us test and agree decisions quickly.

Q: Can we use real customer data here?
- No. Please use dummy answers. We don’t store personal data in the prototype.

Q: Why do some questions appear and disappear?
- The flow adapts based on your answers. This is intentional to make it easier to complete and reduce errors.

Q: What does “alpha” vs “beta” mean on a card?
- Alpha: early; we’re still shaping it. Beta: more complete; ready for wider testing.

Q: How do I get the admin password?
- Ask the Nile team. Admin shows extra options like “View Diff” and “Export CSV”.

Q: What if I find a mistake or have an idea?
- Note the journey name, a brief description, and share it with the team. We’ll log it and decide next steps.

Q: Can we get a copy of the questions in a spreadsheet?
- Yes. Use Export CSV on the journey card (admin view). It mirrors the schema and includes references back to the source rows where available.
