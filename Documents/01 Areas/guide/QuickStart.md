# Quick Start (2 minutes)

For anyone testing the prototype (no technical steps needed). The system includes advanced features like field grouping and debugging tools.

1) Open Mission Control
- You’ll receive a link (e.g., https://…/). It opens the landing page.
- You’ll see cards with journey names and status (alpha/beta).

2) Open a Journey
- Click a card to open that journey.
- Follow the on‑screen prompts and answer the questions.
- Use “Next” and “Back” to move between steps.

3) Fix Errors
- If something is missing or in the wrong format, an error summary appears at the top and by the fields.
- Click the links in the summary to jump to a field and correct it.

4) (Optional) Admin Controls
- Click “Admin” on the landing page and enter the password provided by the team.
- You’ll see extra links for each journey:
  - View Diff (a simple report)
  - Export CSV
  - Conditions Report (flags conditionality issues)

5) Share Feedback
- Note any confusing wording, missing help, or steps that felt too long.
- Send your notes to the Nile team with the journey name and a short description.

# Tips
- Avoid entering real personal information; this is a prototype.
- Screens may adapt (hide/show) based on your earlier answers.
- Alpha means early; expect changes and rough edges.
- **Debug visibility**: Use **Explain Visibility** toggle or add `?explain=1` to URL to see field logic
- **Admin debugging**: Use **Conditions Report** for comprehensive conditional logic validation
- Notice **field grouping** that reduces cognitive load in complex sections
- Try **complex fields** with add/remove functionality where available
