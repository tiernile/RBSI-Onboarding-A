# Component Showcase PRD

## Executive Summary
Build an interactive component showcase (similar to Storybook) within the RBSI prototype to demonstrate, document, and test KYCP-faithful form components. This will serve as both a reference implementation for FinOpz and a testing ground for component behavior.

## Problem Statement
- FinOpz needs clear documentation of component specifications and behaviors
- Designers need a way to preview and test components in isolation
- Developers need code examples and implementation patterns
- No current way to verify component parity with KYCP requirements

## Goals
1. **Primary**: Create a living documentation of all KYCP form components
2. **Secondary**: Enable rapid prototyping and testing of new patterns
3. **Tertiary**: Establish visual regression testing baseline

## User Stories

### As a FinOpz Developer
- I want to see all available components and their variants
- I want to copy code examples for implementation
- I want to understand component props and configuration options
- I want to verify accessibility compliance

### As a Designer
- I want to preview components in different states (default, hover, focus, error, disabled)
- I want to test component behavior with real data
- I want to ensure visual consistency across all forms

### As a QA Tester
- I want to verify component functionality matches specifications
- I want to test edge cases and error states
- I want to check accessibility features

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Component Gallery**
   - Grid/list view of all available components
   - Categories: Inputs, Selections, Layout, Feedback
   - Search and filter capabilities

2. **Interactive Playground**
   - Live component preview
   - Props panel for real-time configuration
   - State management (show different states)
   - Form validation examples

3. **Documentation Panel**
   - Component description and use cases
   - Props table with types and defaults
   - Code examples (Vue template and usage)
   - Accessibility notes and ARIA requirements

4. **Code Examples**
   - Copy-to-clipboard functionality
   - Syntax highlighting
   - Multiple examples per component
   - Integration patterns

### Components to Include

#### Input Components
- **KycpInput**: Text, email, number, tel, password variants
- **KycpTextarea**: Multiline text with character count
- **KycpSelect**: Single selection dropdown
- **KycpMultiSelect**: Multiple selection with tags
- **KycpDatePicker**: Date selection
- **KycpSearch**: Search input with suggestions

#### Selection Components
- **KycpRadio**: Radio button group
- **KycpCheckbox**: Single checkbox
- **KycpCheckboxGroup**: Multiple checkboxes
- **KycpToggle**: On/off switch

#### Layout Components
- **KycpFieldGroup**: Container with gray header (as shown in image)
- **KycpFieldWrapper**: Label, input, help text, error container
- **KycpFormSection**: Logical grouping of fields
- **KycpCard**: Content container

#### Feedback Components
- **KycpTag**: Removable chips/pills
- **KycpError**: Error message display
- **KycpHelp**: Help text and tooltips
- **KycpProgress**: Form progress indicator

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Component showcase loads in < 2 seconds
- Live updates render in < 100ms
- No impact on main application performance

#### Accessibility
- All examples meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Screen reader compatible
- Focus management demonstrated

#### Browser Support
- Chrome (latest 2 versions)
- Firefox (latest 2 versions)
- Safari (latest 2 versions)
- Edge (latest 2 versions)

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture
- Standalone page accessible from Mission Control
- Component library in `/components/kycp/`
- Shared design system CSS in `/assets/kycp-design.css`
- Props documentation extracted from component definitions

### Technology Stack
- Vue 3 Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- CSS custom properties for theming
- No external UI libraries (custom components only)

### URL Structure
- `/showcase` - Main gallery page
- `/showcase/[component]` - Individual component page (optional)

## Success Metrics
1. All 15+ components documented and interactive
2. 100% prop coverage in documentation
3. Code examples for every component variant
4. Accessibility audit passed
5. FinOpz sign-off on component parity

## MVP Scope
1. 8 core components (Input, Select, Radio, Checkbox, Textarea, FieldGroup, Tag, Button)
2. Basic props panel
3. Code examples with copy functionality
4. Simple navigation from Mission Control

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced components (DatePicker, MultiSelect)
- Theme customization panel
- Export component specifications
- Visual regression testing
- Figma design tokens sync

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Component drift from KYCP | High | Regular sync meetings with FinOpz |
| Incomplete documentation | Medium | Automated prop extraction |
| Performance issues | Low | Lazy loading, virtualization |

## Timeline
- Week 1: Core component development
- Week 2: Showcase page and navigation
- Week 3: Documentation and examples
- Week 4: Testing and refinement

## Dependencies
- KYCP component specifications from FinOpz
- Design tokens and style guide
- Accessibility requirements documentation
