# Conditionality Fix - Success Report

## Issue Resolved ✅
**CRITICAL BUG FIXED**: Visibility conditions in v2.1 are now working properly.

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
- All conditional fields were showing unconditionally
- Delaware/Non-Delaware appeared regardless of USA selection
- Raw visibility strings instead of structured conditions

### Solution Implemented
1. **Copied visibility parser** from working v1.1 import script
2. **Added value canonicalization** using `value_aliases` mapping
3. **Regenerated v2.1 schema** with proper conditional structure

### Before (Broken)
```yaml
visibility:
  - conditions:
    - raw: GENIndicativeAppetiteFundAdminDomicile = USA
```

### After (Fixed) ✅
```yaml
visibility:
- entity: entity
  targetKeys: []
  allConditionsMustMatch: true
  conditions:
  - sourceKey: GENIndicativeAppetiteFundAdminDomicile
    operator: eq
    value: United States
```

## Verification Results

### Delaware Field Test ✅
- Field: "Is it Delaware or Non-Delaware?"
- Key: `GENIndicativeAppetiteFundAdminDomicileUSA`
- **Condition**: Only shows when `GENIndicativeAppetiteFundAdminDomicile == "United States"`
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING

### Value Canonicalization ✅
- Raw condition: `"= USA"` 
- Canonized to: `"= United States"` (matches option value)
- **Status**: ✅ WORKING

## Impact
- **High Priority Issues**: RESOLVED
- **User Testing**: Now possible with proper conditional flow
- **Form Logic**: Behaves as expected
- **Nile Enhancements**: Preserved alongside working conditionality

## Files Updated
- ✅ `apps/prototype/scripts/import_non_lux_2_1.py` - Added visibility parser
- ✅ `apps/prototype/data/schemas/non-lux-lp-2-1/schema-kycp.yaml` - Regenerated with proper conditions
- ✅ `apps/prototype/data/generated/non-lux-lp-2-1-copy-map.json` - Copy tracking updated

## Next Steps
1. Test other critical conditional paths in the running app
2. Verify accordion behavior is preserved
3. Prepare for user testing sessions

## Technical Notes
- Used exact `parse_visibility()` function from v1.1
- Includes AND/OR logic parsing
- Handles quoted values correctly
- Maintains backward compatibility
