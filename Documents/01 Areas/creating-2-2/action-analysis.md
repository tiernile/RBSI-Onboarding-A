# Action Column Analysis - v2.2 Implementation

## Overview
Analysis of the "Action" column from the spreadsheet to understand field handling guidance for systematic implementation in v2.2.

## Action Pattern Categories

### 1. Content/Data Architecture (DA) - 147 fields
- **Pattern**: `"DA"` (most common action)
- **Interpretation**: Data Architecture changes needed
- **Next Steps**: Review with SMEs for specific requirements

### 2. Internal Processing - 65 fields
- **SM (internal)**: 30 fields - Subject Matter Expert internal processing
- **LG (internal)**: 22 fields - Legal team internal processing  
- **LD (internal)**: 8 fields - Legal Documents internal processing
- **BT (internal)**: 5 fields - Business Technology internal processing

### 3. Nile Team Actions - 41 fields
- **"Nile"**: 10 fields - General Nile team actions
- **"Nile - Reword/reconfigure address section"**: 11 fields
- **"Nile - Rename section/s and questions to be considered"**: 11 fields
- **"Nile - can we capture the info in a better way"**: 7 fields
- **"NILE - Jurisdiction/Domiciled/location"**: 5 fields

### 4. Visibility/Conditional Logic - Multiple fields
- **Visibility conditions**: Fields requiring conditional display logic
- **Account type dependencies**: Show/hide based on account selection
- **Geography-based conditions**: Based on jurisdiction/location

### 5. Paul Structural Changes - 6 fields
- **"PAUL"**: 3 fields - Direct Paul recommendations
- **"PAUL + NILE - Jurisdiction/Domiciled/location"**: 3 fields - Combined actions

### 6. Business Process Changes - Various
- **"Reposition"**: Field ordering/placement changes
- **"Consider order"**: Review field sequence
- **"Reorder lookup values"**: Option list reorganization

## High-Priority Action Types

### Immediate Implementation Candidates
1. **Empty Actions (320 fields)**: Already correctly placed, no changes needed
2. **Paul Actions (6 fields)**: Direct structural guidance to implement
3. **Visibility Conditions**: Technical implementation for conditional logic

### Systematic Review Required
1. **DA (147 fields)**: Largest category requiring SME consultation
2. **Nile Actions (41 fields)**: Content and UX improvements
3. **Internal Processing (65 fields)**: Backend workflow considerations

## Methodology for v2.2 Enhancement

### Phase 1: Low-Hanging Fruit
- ✅ Implement Paul's structural suggestions (already done)
- ⏳ Address visibility condition fields
- ⏳ Implement field repositioning/ordering changes

### Phase 2: Content Enhancements  
- ⏳ Process Nile rewording/reconfiguration suggestions
- ⏳ Review and implement address section improvements
- ⏳ Enhance jurisdiction/location field handling

### Phase 3: Complex Changes
- ⏳ Coordinate with SMEs on DA requirements
- ⏳ Internal process workflow integration
- ⏳ Lookup value reordering and enhancement

## Reworded Column Discovery ✅ RESOLVED
**User Reference**: "Replace with Mandatory Wholesale Depositor Questions" was found in the **"Reworded?" column (K)**, not the "Action" column (J).

**Findings from Original Spreadsheet**:
- **Row 6**: GENIndicativeAppetiteQuestions 
- **Reworded**: "Replace with Mandatory Wholesale Depositor Questions"
- **Total reworded entries**: 257 fields have reworded suggestions

**Resolution**: Added "Reworded?" column to v2.2 mapping and regenerated copy map to capture all reworded content for **human review**.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Human-in-the-Loop Required
**Content changes require human oversight**:
- **257 reworded suggestions** captured for systematic human review
- **376 action items** need SME evaluation and approval
- **No automatic content implementation** - all changes require human decision

## Next Steps for **Human-Guided** Implementation
1. **Present reworded suggestions** to stakeholders for review and approval
2. **Coordinate with SMEs** for action item evaluation (DA, Nile, Internal)
3. **Create approval workflow** for content modifications
4. **Implement only approved changes** with proper change tracking

## Status
- **Analysis Phase**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation Planning**: ⏳ In Progress
- **Technical Implementation**: ⏳ Pending systematic approach
