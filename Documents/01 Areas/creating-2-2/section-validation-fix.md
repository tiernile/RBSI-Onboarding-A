# Section Validation Fix - Invalid Nile Suggestions Filtered ✅

## Issue Resolved
**Data Entry Error**: Fixed erroneous Nile section suggestions where help text was mistakenly entered as section names instead of proper section titles.

## Problem Identified
During testing, found that help text had been accidentally placed in the "Nile Suggested Section" column, creating nonsensical section names:

### Invalid Section Names Found
1. **"For most businesses, choose the Cash Management Account - it handles multiple currencies (GBP, USD, EUR and others), fixed-term deposits, and all electronic payments. If you need cheques or direct debits choose the Business Current Account - this is a standard GBP account with cheque book facility."** (Field: `GENAccountType`)

2. **"This could include payments of professional fees, dividend receipts or payments, rental income, expenses, trading income, purchases of wholesale goods or cash elements of an investment portfolio"** (Field: `GENCashMngtAccPurpose`)

3. **"For example: office account, collections account, rental account"** (Field: `GENCashMngtAccDesignation`)

These are clearly help text/examples, not section titles.

## Root Cause
Manual data entry error in the v2.1 spreadsheet where help text was copy-pasted into the wrong column ("Nile Suggested Section" instead of help text fields).

## Solution Implemented

### Added Section Validation Logic
```python
def is_valid_section_name(section_text):
    if not section_text:
        return False
    # Section names should be short titles, not long help text
    if len(section_text) > 100:  # Too long to be a section name
        return False
    # Check for characteristics of help text rather than section names
    help_text_indicators = [
        'for example', 'could include', 'such as', 'this is a',
        'if you need', 'choose the', 'it handles', 'office account',
        'professional fees', 'dividend receipts', 'trading income'
    ]
    section_lower = section_text.lower()
    if any(indicator in section_lower for indicator in help_text_indicators):
        return False
    return True
```

### Validation Criteria
- **Length check**: Section names > 100 characters are rejected
- **Content check**: Text containing help indicators like "for example", "could include", "if you need" are rejected
- **Specific patterns**: References to specific account types, payment examples, etc. are rejected

## Results ✅

### Before Fix
- **Accordion sections**: 10+ (including invalid long text sections)
- **Section names**: Included multi-sentence help text
- **User experience**: Confusing accordion layout with nonsensical section titles

### After Fix
- **Accordion sections**: 9 (clean, proper sections only)
- **Section names**: Only legitimate section titles preserved
- **Affected fields**: Now assigned to appropriate fallback sections
- **Valid Nile suggestions**: 1 remaining ("Start A New Application")

### Clean Section List ✅
```
- Start A New Application: 2 fields
- General: 252 fields  
- Details Of The New Customer Account: 26 fields
- Business Appetite (Eligibility): 3 fields
- Risk Profile: 1 field
- Intermediary Details: 3 fields
- Business Activity: 4 fields
- Banking Requirements: 10 fields
- Eq Electronic Banking: 5 fields
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Clean accordion navigation** without nonsensical section names
- ✅ **Proper field organization** using fallback section mapping
- ✅ **Data quality improvement** by filtering invalid suggestions
- ✅ **Prevented future errors** through validation logic

## Technical Implementation
- **Validation function**: Added to `process_field()` in import script
- **Automatic filtering**: Invalid suggestions ignored, fallback to label-based mapping
- **Non-destructive**: Original data preserved in copy map for audit
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more validation patterns if needed

## Files Updated
- ✅ `apps/prototype/scripts/import_non_lux_2_1.py` - Added section validation logic
- ✅ `apps/prototype/data/schemas/non-lux-lp-2-1/schema-kycp.yaml` - Regenerated with clean sections

## Prevention
This validation logic will catch similar data entry errors in future spreadsheet imports, ensuring only proper section names are used for accordion organization.

## Status
**COMPLETE** - v2.1 now has clean section organization with invalid Nile suggestions properly filtered out.
