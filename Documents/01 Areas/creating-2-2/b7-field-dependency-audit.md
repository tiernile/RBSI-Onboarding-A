# B7 Field Dependency Audit - Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview
B7 "Controlling Parties" section has **critical UX issues** due to field duplication and poor grouping. This audit documents all fields, their relationships, and proposes consolidation strategy.

## Problem Summary
- **17 total fields** in B7 section
- **Massive duplication**: Same questions appear 3x with different field IDs
- **Poor visual hierarchy**: Users can't tell which follow-ups relate to which parent questions
- **Confusing user experience**: Same question appears multiple times in different contexts

### **4. Limited Partnership Group** âœ… (Good Structure)
- **GENlimitedpartnershipstructure** (152) - "Limited Partnership structure" [NO CONDITIONS]

## User Journey Analysis

### **Scenario 1: UK Jurisdiction + Pre-App Questions = YES**
User sees **BOTH** duplicates for each question:
- "Is there a Fund Manager?" (appears 2x)
- "Where is the Fund Manager domiciled?" (appears 2x if they answer Yes above)
- "Is it Delaware or Non-Delaware?" (appears 2x if they select United States above)
- Same pattern for Investment Adviser questions

### **Scenario 2: Non-UK Jurisdiction + Pre-App Questions = YES**
User sees:
- "Is there a Fund Manager?" (GENFundMngr + GENIndicativeAppetiteFundMng versions)
- "Is there an Investment Adviser?" (GENOpeningInvestmentAdviser + GENIndicativeAppetiteOpeningInvestmentAdviser versions)

### **Scenario 3: UK Jurisdiction + Pre-App Questions = NO**
User sees:
- "Is there a Fund Manager?" (GENFundMngr + GENUKIndicativeAppetiteFundMng versions)
- "Is there an Investment Adviser?" (GENOpeningInvestmentAdviser + GENUKIndicativeAppetiteOpeningInvestmentAdviser versions)

### **Scenario 4: Non-UK Jurisdiction + Pre-App Questions = NO**
User sees only:
- "Is there a Fund Manager?" (GENFundMngr version only)
- "Is there an Investment Adviser?" (GENOpeningInvestmentAdviser version only)

## Critical Issues Identified

### **1. Functional Duplication**
Same questions with identical purpose but different field IDs create confusion and poor UX.

### **2. Broken Visual Hierarchy**
Related questions are scattered throughout the section rather than grouped together.

### **3. Dependency Chain Conflicts**
Multiple versions of same question create complex dependency chains that are hard to follow.

### **4. Field Ordering Issues**
Paul's ordering (143, 144, 145, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152) doesn't group related fields together.

## Consolidation Strategy

### **Phase 1: Merge Duplicate Fields**
Combine functionally identical fields using OR conditions:

#### **Fund Manager Consolidation:**
```yaml
- key: GENFundMngr_CONSOLIDATED
  label: Is there a Fund Manager within the structure?
  visibility:
  - entity: entity
    targetKeys: []
    allConditionsMustMatch: false  # OR logic
    conditions:
    - sourceKey: GENIndicativeAppetiteQuestions
      operator: eq
      value: 'YES'
    - sourceKey: GENBankAccountJurisdiction
      operator: eq
      value: United Kingdom
    # Plus: Always visible when neither condition applies
```

#### **Investment Adviser Consolidation:**
Similar approach - merge three versions into one with OR visibility logic.

### **Phase 2: Reorder for Visual Hierarchy**
Group parent â†’ child â†’ grandchild sequences together:

**Proposed New Order:**
1. Secretary (143) â†’ Secretary Name (144)
2. Fund Manager (145) â†’ Fund Manager Location (146) â†’ Delaware Question (147)
3. Investment Adviser (148) â†’ Investment Adviser Location (149) â†’ Delaware Question (150)
4. Limited Partnership (151)

### **Phase 3: Add Visual Grouping**
Create sub-section headers or indentation to show relationships:
- "Secretary Information"
- "Fund Manager Details" 
- "Investment Adviser Details"
- "Partnership Structure"

## Expected Benefits
âœ… **Eliminate duplicate questions** - No more seeing same question 2-3 times
âœ… **Clear parent-child relationships** - Logical grouping of related fields
âœ… **Maintain all functionality** - All business logic preserved with OR conditions
âœ… **Improved user comprehension** - Users understand form structure better
âœ… **Reduced form length** - From 17 fields to ~8 fields (significant reduction)

## Implementation Priority
**HIGH PRIORITY** - This directly affects user experience and form completion rates.

## Next Steps
1. Update import script to implement field consolidation logic
2. Create visual grouping components for sub-sections
3. Test all user journey scenarios to ensure no functionality lost
4. Validate consolidated visibility conditions work correctly

**Files:** 17 fields â†’ 8 consolidated fields (52% reduction)  
**User Impact:** Eliminates confusing duplicate questions  
**Business Logic:** Fully preserved through OR visibility conditions
