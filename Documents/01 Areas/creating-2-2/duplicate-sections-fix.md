# Duplicate Sections Bug - Fixed ✅

## Issue Identified
User reported seeing duplicate sections and questions in the v2.1 form:
- "Where would you like to bank?" appearing twice
- "How are you applying?" appearing twice  
- Sections appearing in duplicate

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem
The import script was creating two separate accordion sections due to inconsistent capitalization:
1. `"Start a new application"` with `GENBankAccountJurisdiction`  
2. `"Start a New Application"` with `GENIndicativeAppetiteCustomerApplicationTypeFundsandFundsRelated`

### Evidence
```yaml
# BEFORE (Broken) - Two sections with same key but different titles
accordions:
- key: start-a-new-application
  title: Start a new application
  fields:
  - GENBankAccountJurisdiction
- key: start-a-new-application  # DUPLICATE KEY!
  title: Start a New Application
  fields:
  - GENIndicativeAppetiteCustomerApplicationTypeFundsandFundsRelated
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Section Name Normalization
Added consistent Title Case normalization for all section names:
```python
# Normalize section name (capitalize consistently)
field['_section'] = nile_section.title()  # Convert to Title Case
```

### 2. Accordion Deduplication
Added section grouping logic to merge fields with normalized section names:
```python
# Normalize section name to prevent duplicates
section_normalized = section.title()  # Consistent Title Case
if section_normalized not in sections:
    sections[section_normalized] = []
sections[section_normalized].append(field['key'])
```

## Results ✅

### Before Fix
- **13 accordion sections** (with duplicates)
- Fields appearing multiple times
- Broken user experience

### After Fix
- **12 accordion sections** (deduplicated)
- Single "Start A New Application" section containing both fields:
  - `GENBankAccountJurisdiction` (Where would you like to bank?)
  - `GENIndicativeAppetiteCustomerApplicationTypeFundsandFundsRelated` (How are you applying?)

### Verification
```yaml
# AFTER (Fixed) - Single merged section
accordions:
- key: start-a-new-application
  title: Start A New Application
  fields:
  - GENBankAccountJurisdiction
  - GENIndicativeAppetiteCustomerApplicationTypeFundsandFundsRelated
```

## Impact
- ✅ **Duplicate sections eliminated**
- ✅ **Clean user experience restored**
- ✅ **Proper accordion grouping maintained**
- ✅ **All Nile enhancements preserved**

## Technical Notes
- Used Python `.title()` method for consistent capitalization
- Added deduplication logic at both field assignment and accordion generation levels
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing section mapping logic
