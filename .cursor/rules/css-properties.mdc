### CSS and Styling
**⚠️ NEVER define CSS variables in scoped styles!**
- CSS custom properties (variables) MUST be defined in `app.vue` in non-scoped `<style>` blocks
- Component-specific styles go in `<style scoped>` blocks in individual components
- Vue's scoped styles transform selectors, so `:root` in scoped styles doesn't work globally
